## Project 1: US National Parks Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Project Overview

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on information about U.S. National Parks. Data is collected from multiple sources, including APIs, web pages, and CSV files, and integrated to uncover insights about park locations, visitor trends, amenities, and other key attributes.

⸻

Features
	•	Data collection from API, web scraping, and CSV datasets.
	•	Data cleaning and preprocessing for consistent formatting.
	•	Analysis of park attributes, visitation statistics, and geographic distribution.
	•	Visualizations to highlight trends and insights.
	•	Summary of key findings to inform park management and tourism insights.

⸻

Technologies Used
	•	Python: pandas, NumPy, requests, BeautifulSoup, Matplotlib, Seaborn
	•	Data Sources: Official National Parks API, websites, CSV datasets
	•	Tools: Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization
